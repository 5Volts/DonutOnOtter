In our CPE 233 class at Cal Poly SLO, we learned about assembly language and computer architecture. We spent 3 months building the fragments of
CPU, called the Otter, and finally putting it all together. For our final project, we tried modifying and compiling Andy Sloane's donut.c code, which 
generates a rotating 3D donut, and the putting it on the Otter as a test program.
